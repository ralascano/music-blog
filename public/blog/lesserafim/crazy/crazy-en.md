# Analysis of "CRAZY" by LE SSERAFIM - A Burst of Energy and Confidence

## Introduction

The song "CRAZY" by LE SSERAFIM has been a groundbreaking release. Many fans (myself included) have been eagerly anticipating the fourth mini-album since the 1800-hot-n-fun performance due to its energy, which once again demonstrates the group's identity as bold and powerful. This is all thanks to the high-quality production behind it, reflecting the growth and dedication of these girls towards their fans.

## Theme and Lyrics

We all agree that the two lines that stand out the most are “Act like an angel and dress like crazy” and “All the girls are girling.” These lines form the essence of the song, playing with the idea of appearing angelic while also suggesting a blend of boldness and innocence, advocating for authenticity without being intimidated by stereotypes.

The mix of Korean and English is always intriguing in LE SSERAFIM’s songs, as they create harmony between the two languages, and in this case, express a release of expectations and a celebration of feminine identity. Lines like “내 심장에 강림 (My heart beats strong)” and “난 그런 재질 (I’m that type)” emphasize empowerment and confidence. The mention of figures like Galileo in “스스로 심판해 매일 (I judge myself every day)” adds an introspective layer, suggesting that this self-acceptance and boldness come through personal reflection.

The song, therefore, resonates with a young audience that challenges labels, encouraging them to be authentic and not conform to traditional molds. The refrain “All the girls are girling” also reflects a celebration of femininity in its various facets, resonating with those who seek to see themselves represented in all their complexity.

## Musical Style

The song falls within the house genre and features an EDM base, highlighting both the energy and the bold message. The structure and repetitive choruses (like “Da-da-da-da-da”) create a festive and catchy vibe, ideal for a song that calls for letting go and enjoying the moment.

Produced with vibrant synthesizers and heavy percussion, “CRAZY” keeps the listener in suspense and full of adrenaline. The beat transitions, particularly between the verses and chorus, create an atmosphere that reflects the “crazy” and rebellious feeling.

## Vocals and Rap

LE SSERAFIM’s vocals stand out for their versatility. The vocalists combine strong, high tones with short, rhythmic phrases that maintain energy and attitude in each verse. In the chorus, the repetition and vocal strength are palpable, especially in phrases like “Act like an angel and dress like crazy.”

The rap section by Kazuha and Huh Yunjin is one of the most impactful moments. The fast delivery and bold words, like “난 그런 재질 (I’m that type),” emphasize the defiant attitude that LE SSERAFIM seeks to convey. It adds contrast and dynamism to the song, giving it an edgier twist.

It's worth mentioning that Eunchae's rap, although criticized by some, ended up being one of the essential parts of the song. Paired with the girls’ choreography, it highlights their growth following all the “feedback.”

## Choreography and Scenography

As expected, the choreography and scenography are of a high level, showing that there’s really no comparison.

The choreography is dynamic and powerful, showcasing their synchronization with precise movements. The iconic part begins with “Act like an angel and dress like crazy,” establishing a visually impactful moment.

The intense colors and scene changes show the “craziness” and fun the song aims to express, emphasizing Sakura’s main part with the line “I'm an Otaku bestie” alongside her standout dance.

## Impact and Reception
